This is an update with a huge focus on usability. tera-proxy now functions like a proper CLI application and the website got a [major overhaul](https://github.com/meishuu/tera-proxy/commit/_TODO).

<!-- Head on over to the [releases page](https://github.com/meishuu/tera-proxy/releases) for the latest download. -->

## Summary

<!-- Everything got a proper tag and version bump to 1.0.0, as well as being published to [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/). -->

The website changed to the sleek [Minimal Mistakes](https://github.com/mmistakes/minimal-mistakes) theme and had a bunch of new content added, including better guides and a [module directory]({{ '/modules' | absolute_url }}).

But the real star of the show is `proxy.js` which got a [whole bunch of changes](https://github.com/meishuu/tera-proxy/compare/c0c583ef76f964f0c606785294471128fcda3b24...master):
* `servers.json` is gone! Now you can use a super customizable configuration file... or not, because **now we proxy all servers on all regions by default!**
* Closing the proxies *should* be a lot faster too, assuming your scripts clean up properly. (Devs, now is the time to make sure your `destructor()` is doing its job.)
* Console logging found the crayon drawer. Colors were added and enabled by default, but you can also turn them off, or make logging louder, or quieter, or even [pipe straight to bunyan]().
* No more clobbering your hosts file. The old implementation was really awful, so hopefully this new one should lead to less destruction.

To find out more, you can either check the [README](https://github.com/meishuu/tera-proxy/tree/master#readme) or have a look at the [user]({{ '/user-guide' | absolute_url }}) or [developer]({{ '/developer-guide' | absolute_url }}) guides.
