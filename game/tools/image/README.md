Image
=====
This tool converts TERA's image format into PNGs.

Usage
=====
First, install dependencies by running `npm install` in this directory. Then,
execute the script with the first argument being the log file that you want to
parse images from. The images will be saved in the `img` directory without
overwriting, which shouldn't be a problem since guild emblem updates bump a
version number.
