This is an update with a huge focus on usability. tera-proxy now functions like a proper CLI application and the website got a [major overhaul](https://github.com/meishuu/tera-proxy/commit/1e2344274bd7c40f6d247e40940a93fb2d15bbf3).

Head on over to the [release page](https://github.com/meishuu/tera-proxy/releases) for the latest download.

## Summary

Everything got a proper tag and version bump, as well as being published to [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/).

The website changed to the sleek [Minimal Mistakes](https://github.com/mmistakes/minimal-mistakes) theme and had a bunch of new content added, including better guides and a [module directory]({{ '/modules' | absolute_url }}).

But the real star of the show is `proxy.js` which got a [whole bunch of changes](https://github.com/meishuu/tera-proxy/compare/c0c583ef76f964f0c606785294471128fcda3b24...v1.0.0):
* `servers.json` is gone! Now you can use a super customizable YAML config file... or not, because **now we proxy all servers on all regions by default!**
* Closing the proxies *should* be a lot faster too, assuming your scripts clean up properly. (Devs, now is the time to make sure your `destructor()` is doing its job.)
* Console logging found the crayon drawer. Colors were added and enabled by default, but you can also turn them off, or make logging louder, or quieter, or even pipe straight to [bunyan](https://github.com/trentm/node-bunyan#readme).
* No more clobbering your hosts file. The old implementation was really awful, so hopefully this new one should lead to less destruction.
* Also, interoperability with [Alkahest](https://github.com/alexrp/alkahest)! Check the [Alkahest wiki](https://github.com/alexrp/alkahest/wiki/Interoperability) for more info.

To find out more, you can either check the [README](https://github.com/meishuu/tera-proxy/tree/v1.0.0#readme) or have a look at the [user]({{ '/user-guide' | absolute_url }}) or [developer]({{ '/developer-guide' | absolute_url }}) guides.
