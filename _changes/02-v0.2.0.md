This release went live at the same time as the [NA Valkyrie patch](http://tera.enmasse.com/news-page/patch-notes/patch-540-honorbound). Aside from a short Discord announcement and an accompanying [tumblr post](https://komyou.tumblr.com/post/159540587970), there wasn't a whole lot to say about this update.

## Summary

* The first iteration of [this very website](https://meishuu.github.io/tera-proxy/) was launched.
* [`baldera-logger`](https://github.com/meishuu/baldera-logger) was created—the first of many steps towards being able to provide better tech support for users. Everything in the `tera-proxy` suite now makes use of it as an optional dependency.

## Details

### [tera-data-parser](https://github.com/meishuu/tera-data-parser-js/compare/0cd2ad33405e5f669e2be79df853716ab52bb534...2eb93746cc890bc1d3c8eb3c00456868d52d2f1f)

This update saw a number of additions:
- the `bool` type
- the `object` type
- implicit handling of metatypes (`count` and `offset`)
- *not* erroring on missing `bytes`
- _**way**_ better tests

## Other Changes
